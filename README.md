# NEMp3: A NEM cryptocurrency-based music download store

Purchase wavs with the NEM cryptocurrency. Essentially a stripped-down crypto Bandcamp!

* A MERN-stack SPA, with a few extra React libraries, including Redux, React-Router, Redux Form, Redux Thunk middleware.
* Files are stored on Amazon S3, with stream-friendly aac files transcoded from the uncompressed source audio uploads.
* Payment is via the NEM cryptocurrency, as it has an excellent API and SDK.
* Includes a serviceable HTML Audio player component.
* Log in either with a trusty email/password combo, or via Google's OAuth service.
* Currently free for musicians! No cut from your album price is taken (aside from NEM network fees, of course). Please don't ruin me with AWS fees. :) Monetisation tips and suggestions welcome.
